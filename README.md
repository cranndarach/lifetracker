# Lifetracker

> Keep track of events and trends in your life.

This is sort of the evolved form of my [LifeTracker](http://github.com/cranndarach/lifetracker) app, translated to Electron. Like the rest of LifeTracker, this is largely a learning experience, and so it will develop as my skills develop, and it will not always be clean or elegant. But at the same time, I've been excited about this project for a long time, and so I do plan to keep working on it and see where it can go.

## Installation

Binaries are coming soon! In the meantime, it will need to be built from source. Requires node.js and npm.

Download the repository from the green "Clone or Download" button, or clone via command line:

```sh
git clone http://github.com/cranndarach/lifetracker-electron.git
```

Extract the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` if you downloaded it via the button. If you're un-tarring via command line, that's:

```sh
cd [directory/containing/tarball]
tar -xvf lifetracker-electron.tar.gz
```

Next, `cd` into the directory containing the project, and install via npm:

```sh
cd lifetracker-electron
npm install
```

## Run the app

Once you have successfully installed it, run:

```sh
npm start
```

to start the program!
